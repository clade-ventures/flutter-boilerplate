## ‚ö°Ô∏èGetting Started

### üöö How to run, drive, and build Apk

Example how to run release development app
```shell
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -t lib/main_development.dart --release --flavor development
```
If you want to run with different flavor change development to specific flavor. for ex:
```shell
flutter run -t lib/main_staging.dart --release --flavor staging
flutter run -t lib/main_production.dart --release --flavor production
```

Example how to build release development app
```
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk -t lib/main_development.dart --release --no-shrink --flavor development --split-per-abi
```
If you want to build with different flavor change development to specific flavor. for ex:
```shell
flutter build apk -t lib/main_staging.dart --release --no-shrink --flavor staging --split-per-abi
flutter build apk -t lib/main_production.dart --release --no-shrink --flavor production --split-per-abi
```

Example how to run flutter web app
```
flutter run -t lib/main_development.dart -d chrome
```

Example how to drive automation test on development environment
note that automation test doesn't support release mode
```
flutter drive -t test_driver/app.dart --flavor development
```
